# TODO

## Repository Layout

- [ ] Adopt the proposed top-level ownership layout.
  - [ ] Move the accepted compiler seed and manifest from
    `RangeCompiler/Bootstrap` to `Bootstrap`.
  - [ ] Move the Range-authored compiler phases from
    `RangeCompiler/Sources/Compiler` to `Compiler`.
    - [ ] Keep `Body`, `Driver`, `Graph`, `LLVM`, and `Syntax` as the explicit
      compiler implementation roots.
    - [ ] Make compiler discovery read only those implementation roots instead
      of recursively treating adjacent libraries as project sources.
  - [ ] Move the C runtime from `RangeCompiler/Runtime` to `Runtime`.
  - [ ] Move `RangeCompiler/Sources/Core` to the root `Core` folder.
  - [ ] Move `RangeCompiler/Sources/Foundation` to the root `Foundation`
    folder.
  - [ ] Move `RangeCompiler/Sources/Frameworks` to the root `Frameworks`
    folder, with RangeView at `Frameworks/RangeView`.
  - [ ] Update `Project.range`, source manifests, build-plan logic, scripts,
    fixtures, and documentation to the canonical paths.
  - [ ] Reach a Stage 2/Stage 3 byte-identical fixed point, promote the
    path-aware seed, and independently reproduce it before completing the
    checkpoint.

- [ ] Review the Core and Foundation boundary without collapsing it by folder
  count alone.
  - Core contains the facilities required to describe and bootstrap the basic
    language, including macro machinery and contracts.
  - Foundation currently contains concrete reusable macros such as `Field`,
    `Property`, `Registrable`, and `Syntax`.
  - [ ] Decide macro by macro whether each Foundation facility is fundamental
    enough to move into Core.
  - [ ] Collapse Foundation only if the dependency distinction no longer
    represents a real compilation or package boundary.

## Compiler Storage

- [ ] Replace the compiler's direct RawBuffer dependency incrementally.
  - [x] Add `Buffer.range` to the compiler's manifested Core source set.
  - [x] Migrate `CompilerIntTable.values` from `RawBuffer` to `Buffer<Int>` as
    the first compiler-owned table.
  - [x] Prove the migrated table through the full fixed-point gate and promote
    the independently verified accepted seed.
  - [ ] Widen the migration to the compiler's remaining integer and text
    buffers in separately proven slices.
    - [x] Migrate the function-selection bitmap to `Buffer<Int>` and promote
      its independently verified fixed-point seed.
  - [ ] Delete raw runtime entry points only after no accepted compiler or Core
    path consumes them.
